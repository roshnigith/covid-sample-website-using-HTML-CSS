<p><h2><a id="year 2019-the first case in wuhan"></a>year 2019-the first case in wuhan</h2></p><br>
<p>China eperienced the first ever case of covid-19 developed fromthe sarc virus.<br>it was believed to be produced ninhe ciniease laboeatory of wuhan.
it took millions of life there and slowly started spreading in the rest of the world marking a decade known as the covid decade.<br>


<p><h2><a id="year 2020-covid in india"></a>year 2020-covid in india</h2></p><br>
<p>when covid started spreading in india it was the month of march.India was stilla developing country already facing he terror attacks ,tsunamis,floods all at the same time.<br>I still remember, it was the first year of our college .we already spent 6 months in the hostel wondering how th eresults of the next semeester will be .<br>At tht time our sessionalexams were going on and wesuddenly realised hthat the government has declared covid 19 a pandemic nd all the  college and schools will be shut for 7 days<br>When these seven days became a whole year nobody had ever thought of.<br>The cases in india started increasing gradually,from just 50 to 500 ans crossing 50,000 in just 3 months.<br>

<p><h2><a id="the unforgettable year"></a>the unfogettable year</h2></p>
<p>people not only witnessed the loss of their loved ones ,this year also marked decline in number of IT jobs,loss of jobs of many daily wage workers ,closure of schools and colleges due to continous lockdown.<br>the year was terrible,news of death all around frightening people.<br>.if death was not due tocovid it was surely beacause of hunger .there was a huge requirement of oxygen supply and the vaccine ofcourse.<br>.after 100 years something like this took place whch noone ever dreamt of.<br>if it was a dreampeople wanted it to finish soon but indeed it wasn't.<br>

<p><h2><a id="start from the bottom"></a>start from the bottom</h2></p>
<p>ray of hope came when things started coming on track.India again witnessed a decline in the number of cases of corona.<br>there was less demand of hospital beds and oxygen supply.the process of unlock began and after almost a year people started to go on work again.<br>colleges began opening and schools for 9-12 opened.
